Question1:
Read the input as two limits and Print the output as Palindrome count between the two limits
Example #1; Input : 1 10 Output : 9 Example #2: Input : 1 100 Output : 18

Question2:
Read the input as number and Print the output as Count of Triangles and Circles in the given number
Example #1 :
Input : 12854 Output : 3

Example #2:
Input : 888 Output : 6

Reason : The digits 0,6,9 will have single Circle so the weight will be 1
The digit 4 have single Triangle then the count will be 1
The digit 8 have two Circles so that the count will be 2

Question3:
The program must accept an integer N the input. The program must print the desired pattern as shown in the Example Input/Output section.
Input Format: The first line contains the value of N. Output Format: The list of lines containing the desired pattern as shown in the Example Input/Output sections.
